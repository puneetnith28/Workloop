# 🌀 WorkLoop — AI-Powered Version Control for Creatives

**WorkLoop** is a concept prototype that reimagines how creative professionals manage versions and feedback.  
While developers use Git for tracking code, designers, writers, and marketers still struggle with messy files like `final_v3_realfinal.pdf`.  
WorkLoop brings **Git-style version control** and **AI feedback** to the creative world — through an intuitive, modern interface.

## 🚀 Inspiration

Every designer, writer, or marketer has faced this pain — endless file versions, unclear feedback, and chaos during collaboration.  
We wanted to fix that.

**WorkLoop** is our vision of a smarter creative workflow:  
A single space where every version is tracked, every change summarized, and every creative gets instant, intelligent feedback.

> “If GitHub is for developers, WorkLoop is for creatives.”

## 💡 What It Does

✨ **Dashboard Overview** — View all your creative files with clean version cards and AI-generated summaries.  
🔍 **Visual Version Comparison** — See two versions of your design side-by-side, with highlighted differences.  
🤖 **AI-Powered Feedback (Concept)** — Imagine instant, constructive feedback on each version: design clarity, color accessibility, and tone suggestions.  
⚙️ **Integrations (Future)** — Connect tools like Figma, Google Docs, or Notion for seamless creative version control.  

*(The prototype currently focuses on showcasing UI and user experience — the backend & AI features are part of the concept.)*
